# ### Challenge 2 - Reverse a string
#
# Reverse a string in place. In other words, do not create a new string or use other methods on the string such as `reverse`. The goal of the problem is to use a loop and the string accessors to figure out which values to swap for other values. Below is some sample output.
#
# ```
# Enter a string:
# reverse_me
# em_esrever
# ```

number = "I love wanton"

def reverse(apple)
  number = number.split("")
  collect =[]

  until i = (apple.length - 1) do
    collect.unshift(number[i])

  end
end
